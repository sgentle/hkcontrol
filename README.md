These are some remote control files for my HK3350 Amplifier's remote-in port. The port is a standard 3.5mm mono jack, so you can just play these files into the jack using a line cable.

I use this command on linux:
```
$ aplay -D plughw:0,0 on.wav
```

I'm not even sure these files are eligible for copyright, but if so I waive any of my rights as outlined here: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/
